## Package usage

This package is used as a dependency for other packages in two scenarios:

1. The other package wants to extend the API and implement a provider that provides data to the Subsystems defined in this package.  Packages in this category include:
[Magic Leap XR Plugin](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.magicleap@1.0/)

1. The other package wants to use the APIs defined in this one.  No current packages in this category.
